## üöÄ Quick Start

### Accessing Cockpit

#### - Option 1: Try it Online
If you just want to take a look at Cockpit, you can visit our **[live demo](https://docs.bluerobotics.com/cockpit)** to experience it instantly in your browser.

#### - Option 2: Download the Native App (Recommended)
Download the [latest release](https://blueos.cloud/cockpit/docs/latest/usage/installation/#self-contained-application) of our native desktop app for your platform.
It offers the best performance, as well as all the features available in the app.

We have dedicated builds for every Desktop platform, so make sure you're using the correct one to have the best possible experience.
- **Windows**: `.exe`
- **macOS (Intel)**: `x64 .dmg`
- **macOS (Apple Silicon)**: `arm64 .dmg`
- **Linux**: `.AppImage`
- **Steam OS**: `.Flatpak`

#### - Option 3: Install the BlueOS Extension
If you're using BlueOS, you can install Cockpit [from the Extensions page](https://blueos.cloud/docs/stable/usage/advanced/#extensions).


#### - Option 4: Docker (for Developers)
```bash
docker run -p 8080:8080 bluerobotics/cockpit:latest
```

Once you have Cockpit running, it's time to connect to your vehicle:

### Connecting to your vehicle

If you're running Cockpit as a BlueOS extension, it should automatically connect to your vehicle, but if you're running the native app and you have BlueOS in your vehicle, you can use the Vehicle Discovery dialog to easily connect to it. If for some reason you missed this dialog during boot you can just head to `Menu>Settings>General` and find the "Search for vehicles" button there.

If you have your vehicle connected through a serial interface, like a [USB-Serial radio](https://ardupilot.org/plane/docs/common-telemetry-landingpage.html#common-telemetry-landingpage), you should [manually configure the connection address]((https://blueos.cloud/cockpit/docs/latest/usage/getting-started/#general-configuration)). To do that activate the checkmark for "Mavlink2Rest connection" under `Menu>Settings>General` and use `serial:path/to/serial/device?baudrate=desired-baudrate` there.

### Streaming video

If you want to stream video from your vehicle and you're not using BlueOS, you will need to run [`mavlink-camera-manager`](https://github.com/mavlink/mavlink-camera-manager) manually in the same machine as Cockpit, activate the checkmark for "WebRTC connection" and use `ws://127.0.0.1:6020` there.

## üñ•Ô∏è Browser vs Desktop: What's the Difference?

Most of the motivation behind having distinct versions with different features is tied to browsers' limitations -- more specifically, the need for secure context to access the most powerful APIs (e.g., filesystem, geolocation, serial communication), which is usually not the case when you're serving Cockpit from a hosted webpage with issued certificates. To overcome this, we moved to shipping additional features in a native app, built over [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/), which also enables us to embed functionality beyond what the browser can provide.

Below is a table summarizing the current status, but in general, you can expect more features and better performance on the native app:

<div align="center">

| **Feature** | **üåê Browser** | **üñ•Ô∏è Desktop** |
|-------------|---------------|----------------|
| **Joystick Support** | Only when tab and window are in focus  | ‚úÖ Window can be unfocused and in the background |
| **Video/Snapshots** | Needs to be downloaded | ‚úÖ Saved directly to your folders |
| **Vehicle Discovery** | ‚ùå Not available | ‚úÖ Auto-scan for vehicles in the network|
| **Updates** | Manual updates required | ‚úÖ Auto-updates / update notifications |
| **System Monitoring** | Memory usage only | ‚úÖ CPU and Memory tracking |
| **Workspace Capture** | ‚ùå Not available | ‚úÖ Full interface screenshots |
| **Performance** | Standard | ‚úÖ Optimized build for each system |
| **Installation** | ‚úÖ No install needed | Requires download |
| **Multi-platform** | ‚úÖ Any device | Windows, macOS, Linux |

</div>

### üéØ **Quick Decision Guide**

**Choose Desktop** for complete experience, auto-updates, system integration, and optimal performance.
**Choose Browser** for testing, quick access, or when you can't install applications.

> **üí° Pro Tip**: Start with the [live demo](https://docs.bluerobotics.com/cockpit) to get familiar with Cockpit, then download the desktop app for regular use to unlock all capabilities!

## üéõÔ∏è Supported Vehicles
Vehicle support is currently focused on ArduPilot-based autopilots communicating over MAVLink.

Since Cockpit was created and is maintained by Blue Robotics, we actively test the application every day against ArduSub and ArduRover vehicles, which we sell, so you can expect the best experience with ROVs and boats.

We currently consider the application to fully cover direct control for both _submarines_ and _boats_, and partially cover automated missions. Currently, Cockpit supports creating missions with basic waypoints and polygon-based surveys. Missions requiring advanced navigation commands and control structures, like loitering, geofencing, and servo control, are not yet supported.

Aerial vehicles (including those running ArduCopter and ArduPlane autopilot firmware) have initial support, including dedicated widgets for _takeoff_ and _landing_.

ArduCopter support has been physically tested, but the primary development team doesn't perform regular tests on any aerial vehicles, so use it at your own risk (also, PRs are very much welcome!).

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Current Limitations

While Cockpit is a powerful and feature-rich ground control station, there are some current limitations to be aware of:

### üìπ **Video Processing Constraints**
Cockpit records video in "chunks" at each second and then reconstructs them into a complete video file through a processing step. For longer recordings, this reconstruction process can exceed your computer's memory capacity.

- [**Recommended limit**](https://github.com/bluerobotics/cockpit/issues/2004): Keep recordings under **30 minutes** for reliable in-app processing
- **For longer recordings**: Use our [online processing tool](https://cockpit-online-processing.rlehmk.dev/) to process video chunks in batches (e.g. 1000 chunks each time) and then combine the resulting files with an external video editing software, like [LosslessCut](https://mifi.no/losslesscut/)
- **Processing capability varies** by computer specifications - systems with more RAM can handle longer recordings. Testing before critical missions is encouraged

### üöÅ **Vehicle Support Gaps**
- [**PX4 autopilots**](https://github.com/bluerobotics/cockpit/issues/2008): Currently not supported, though MAVLink communication is implemented
- **Aerial and Ground vehicles**: Although recognized by the application, those types of vehicles have limited support and testing
- **Contributions welcome**: We're actively seeking community help to add support for PX4 vehicles as well as improve the support for Aerial and Ground vehicles on Ardupilot

### üó∫Ô∏è **Mission Planning Limitations**
- **Basic waypoints only**: Current mission planning supports "pass by" waypoints and polygon surveys
- [**No MAVLink command support**](https://github.com/bluerobotics/cockpit/issues/1737): Advanced waypoints with specific MAVLink commands (loitering, conditional actions, servo control) are not yet implemented
- **Geofencing**: Not currently supported in mission planning

> üí° **Help Us Improve**: Many of these limitations represent opportunities for community contributions. Check our [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/bluerobotics/cockpit/issues) for specific areas where help is needed!

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js** 18+ and **yarn** package manager
- **Git** with submodule support

### Development Workflow
1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch
3. Make your changes
4. Submit a pull request

### Quick Development Start
```bash
# Clone with submodules
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/bluerobotics/cockpit.git
cd cockpit

# Install dependencies
yarn install

# Start development server
yarn dev --host

# Start Electron development server
yarn dev:electron --host
```

The development server will start at `http://localhost:5173` with hot reloading enabled.

### Backend Services (Optional)
For video support, Cockpit relies on a backend service called [mavlink-camera-manager](https://github.com/mavlink/mavlink-camera-manager).
This service is included by default on [BlueOS](https://github.com/bluerobotics/blueos), but if you want to use Cockpit without BlueOS installed on your vehicle, you should install it in the vehicle or in your top-side computer.

### Vehicle Simulation
If you don't have a vehicle, or prefer to test the application against a simulated one, you can do it with our Docker Compose:
```bash
# Start ArduSub simulation
docker-compose -f sim.yml --profile ardusub up

# Other profiles: arducopter, ardurover, arduplane
```
